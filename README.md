# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio page about me.

# Overview
This project in particular was mainly focusing on BootStrap, making it responsive to the screen size getting smaller.
I have 3 HTML files used, and each html has a link to bootstrap's css. However I did also use another CSS file to add color, background image, margin and padding.

# Code Files
The HTML files and CSS files used.

* ['About-page'](index.html)
* ['Portfolio-page'](portfolio.html)
* ['Contact-page'](contact.html)
* ['CSS-file'](asset/css/newportfolio.css)
